    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Swahili beef pilau is a fragrant, one-pot rice dish made by browning beef, sautéing onions, garlic, ginger, and aromatic spices (cumin, cardamom, cloves, cinnamon, black pepper). It often includes potatoes and is cooked with rice in meat broth until fluffy. Serve hot with kachumbari (onion-tomato salad). </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
     <ul>
        <li>Meat: 500g - 1kg beef, cubed</li>
        <li>Rice: 3 cups Basmati rice, soaked for 30 mins</li>
        <li>Spices: 1 tbsp whole pilau masala (cumin, cardamom, cloves, cinnamon, black pepper)</li>

     </ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
     <ol>
        <li>Prepare Meat: Boil beef until tender. If using potatoes, add them to the broth to soften.</li>

        <li>Combine: Add boiled beef to the spices, stirring for 2-3 minutes.</li>
        <li>Cook Rice: Add washed rice and broth/water (use a 1:1.5 ratio of rice to water). Season with salt.</li>
